in order to find the core library you have to run this command:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.

Then you can run the framework by typing:

./framework

or just run 

./framework.sh 

If you want help run 

./framework.sh --help



test


To build:

make depend
make

To clean up: 
make clean


I just fixed this so it would build and run again.  It had a problem when we switched to 64 bit OS a decade ago.
